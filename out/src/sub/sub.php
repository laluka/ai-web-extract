This PHP code includes two endpoints, `'/sub'` and `'/download'`. The first endpoint simply responds with "Sub DIR & Sub FILE" when a GET request is made to it.

The second endpoint, on the other hand, handles file downloads based on the 'GET' parameters passed in the URL. It checks if the `file` parameter exists and then verifies if the file specified by that name actually exists. If all checks are successful, it sends back a header with necessary information for the client to download the file as an octet-stream.

This can be translated into structured JSON as follows:
```json
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "path": "/sub",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": [],
            "input_headers": [],
            "description": "Responds with 'Sub DIR & Sub FILE'",
            "curl_request": "curl -X GET 'https://example.com/sub'"
        },
        {
            "path": "/download",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": ["file"],
            "input_headers": [],
            "description": "Downloads a file based on the 'file' parameter in the URL. If no file is provided or if the specified file does not exist, it responds with an error message.",
            "curl_request": "curl -X GET 'https://example.com/download?file=filename'"
        }
    ]
}
```
Please note that the curl command is only a sample and will need to be adjusted based on your actual server setup. Also, it's assumed that this endpoint should always respond with "Sub DIR & Sub FILE" when accessed via any other HTTP method than GET.
