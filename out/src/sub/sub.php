The provided PHP code snippet doesn't include any HTTP methods, input parameters or headers as those are usually passed through GET and POST requests in a traditional web application. However, the script does include some security related elements such as checking if a file exists before attempting to download it.

To extract all of the above information from your PHP code, you would need to have access to the full application or at least the routes configuration where these details are usually defined.

Here is an example of how this might look like:

```json
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "path": "/sub",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": [],
            "input_headers": [],
            "description": "Sub DIR & Sub FILE",
            "curl_request": ""
        },
        {
            "path": "/download",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": ["file"],
            "input_headers": [],
            "description": "Download File",
            "curl_request": "curl -X GET 'https://example.com/download?file=test.txt'"
        }
    ]
}
```
This is a basic example and may not accurately represent the actual security measures or specific requirements of your application, so it's recommended to look at your application's routes configuration or source code for more accurate information.

Please note that this does not provide you with an exhaustive list of all potential routes, methods, input parameters or headers as this would require inspecting the entirety of your project and is beyond a simple text analysis tool like me.
