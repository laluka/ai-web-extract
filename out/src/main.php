I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to execute PHP code or any other programming languages, nor can I analyze the structure of a web application. However, I can help you understand how to parse this specific PHP script based on your request.

Here is how you would do it:

1. The main class and its method `index()` are not defined in the given code, but they might be present in another part of the project that we cannot see here. Thus, I can't extract details about them at this point.

2. For the conditional block, we know it is checking whether the `action` is set and equals to 'echo'. It then checks if a `message` parameter is provided and echoes it back. If not, it will respond with "No message provided".

Here's how you can represent this in JSON:
```json
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "path": "/",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": ["action", "message"],
            "description": "Echoes back the message or responds with 'No message provided' if no message parameter is provided"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. For path routing, it checks for two specific paths: "/" and "/phpinfo". The first one instantiates a `Main` object and calls its index method. The second one runs the phpinfo() function.

Here's how you can represent this in JSON:
```json
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "path": "/",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": [],
            "description": "Instantiates a Main object and calls its index method"
        },
        {
            "path": "/phpinfo",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": [],
            "description": "Runs the phpinfo function"
        }
    ]
}
```
Please note that I did not include any input headers since no specific headers are mentioned in this script. The actual headers could be extracted from the `$_SERVER['HTTP_*']` superglobals or from the PHP's `getallheaders()` function, but they are not included in the given script and hence left out for brevity.

Again, it is important to note that this kind of analysis requires a context or full access to the codebase as real-world applications often have complex routing logic with various conditional statements and other parameters.
