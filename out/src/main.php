Based on your code, I can identify that you have a single endpoint at path "/". This endpoint accepts the HTTP GET method and accepts two input parameters "action" and "message". If these are set correctly in the URL, it will echo out whatever is passed as the message. Otherwise, it will return a default message: "No message provided".

Additionally, there is an additional path "/phpinfo", which simply calls the phpinfo() function.

Here is the JSON output based on this analysis:

```json
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "path": "/",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "input_parameters": ["action", "message"],
            "description": "Echo message or default 'No message provided'.",
            "curl_request": "Open this URL in a web browser or use curl command: curl -X GET 'http://your-domain.com/?action=echo&message=Hello'"
        },
        {
            "path": "/phpinfo",
            "methods": ["GET"],
            "description": "Display PHP information.",
            "curl_request": "Open this URL in a web browser or use curl command: curl -X GET 'http://your-domain.com/phpinfo'"
        }
    ]
}
```
This output is only based on your code, and there may be more paths, methods, input parameters, headers, etc. if the application continues to grow with more functionality. Make sure to update this JSON response as your application evolves.
